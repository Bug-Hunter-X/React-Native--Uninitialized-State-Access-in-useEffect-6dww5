This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This commonly happens within a functional component before the first render.  Consider this example:

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Count:', count); // Potential error here
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

The `console.log` inside the `useEffect` hook might trigger before the `useState` hook has finished setting the `count` variable.  In such cases, `count` would be `undefined`, leading to an error or unexpected behavior.
