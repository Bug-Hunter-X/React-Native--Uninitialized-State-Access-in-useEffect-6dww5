The solution involves ensuring the state variable is initialized before accessing it.  This can be achieved by checking its value before use:

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Count:', count);
    if (count !== undefined) {
       // Access and use 'count' here
       console.log('Count is defined and usable:', count);
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count !== undefined ? count : 'Loading...'}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

Alternatively, you can use optional chaining to gracefully handle the potential `undefined` value:

```javascript
console.log('Count:', count?.toString());
```

This approach avoids errors by only attempting to access the property if it exists.  Consider using conditional rendering or placeholder text if the value is undefined during initial render.
